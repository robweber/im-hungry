#I'm Hungry

##What is it? 

This is a simple to use web interface for keeping track of your recipes and the ingredients you have on hand to prepare them. You can define different food locations in your home and quickly add/remove product as you go shopping or throw things out. Adding your recipes allows you to use the 'I'm Hungry' feature and compare your ingredient list to your current food items and see what meals you can make without going to the store. 

##Why?

I'm sick of not knowing what is in my house to eat! Like a lot of households our food is broken down and scattered into the refridgerator, extra freezer, cabinets, pantry, etc. When it comes right down to it, I have no idea what's available to eat; let a lone make a meal out of. This simple web app will help keep track of what is available and how to combine that into a breakfast/lunch/dinner/whatever. 

##Features

I plan to add quite a few features, but in the short term these are the goals:

* Create a recipe index, complete with a way to search and "tag" favorite recipes
* Create a list of what food items you have available, and where they are in your house
* Assign "ingredients" to your recipies that correspond to food products
* "I'm Hungry" button that will query available food against your recipies to see what you can make to eat right now
