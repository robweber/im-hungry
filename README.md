#I'm Hungry

##What is it? 

Right now nothing! As you can see by browsing the source this is basically the default CakePHP framework just dumped to a repository. The idea is to build an easy to use web application that will help you keep track of recipes and the food you have on hand to prepare them. 

##Why?

I'm sick of not knowing what is in my house to eat! Like a lot of households our food is broken down and scattered into the refridgerator, extra freezer, cabinets, pantry, etc. When it comes right down to it, I have no idea what's available to eat; let a lone make a meal out of. This simple web app will help keep track of what is available and how to combine that into a breakfast/lunch/dinner/whatever. 

##Features

I plan to add quite a few features, but in the short term these are the goals:

* Create a recipe index, complete with a way to search and "tag" favorite recipes
* Create a list of what food items you have available, and where they are in your house
* Assign "ingredients" to your recipies that correspond to food products
* "I'm Hungry" button that will query available food against your recipies to see what you can make to eat right now
